# Linear_Regression_Assessment_Bicycle

Bikers Data Regression
Overview
This repository contains a simple regression analysis of bikers' data using Python. The code provided in this notebook aims to demonstrate the process of loading, preprocessing, and training a linear regression model on bikers' data.

# Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure to install the required libraries. You can install them using the following commands:
%pip install gdown
%pip install pandas
%pip install numpy

# Getting Started
To get started, simply run the provided Jupyter notebook. The notebook begins by installing the necessary libraries and then downloads the bikers' data CSV file from a Google Drive link using the gdown library.
from IPython.display import clear_output

# Install required libraries
%pip install gdown
%pip install pandas
%pip install numpy

clear_output()

# Download the CSV file.
!gdown 1_eJU8Y-31_l0oq1sSJT6pROJyo-ufuvD


# Loading and Preprocessing Data
The notebook then loads the data into a Pandas DataFrame, separating the target variable (Number of bikers) and the input features. It also splits the data into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn.

# Training the Model
The code proceeds to train a linear regression model using the training data and evaluates its performance on both the training and testing sets.

# Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using mean squared error for both the training and testing sets.

# Conclusion
This notebook provides a simple example of loading bikers' data, training a linear regression model, and evaluating its performance. Feel free to modify and extend the code to suit your specific needs.
